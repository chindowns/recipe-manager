{"name":"Cha Gio (Vietnamese Fried Spring Rolls)","source":"The Woks of Life","servings":"10","activeTime":"25","totalTime":"40","directions":["Soak the dried mung bean noodles in warm water (submerge them completely) for 30 minutes. Drain thoroughly, and cut into ¼ inch pieces.  ","In a large bowl, combine the noodles, ground pork, grated carrot, chopped wood ear mushrooms, shallots, garlic, ginger egg white, fish sauce, vegetable oil, salt, white pepper, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Mix until everything is uniformly combined. ","In a large, shallow bowl or deep plate, dissolve the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar in 1 cup warm water. Sugar is optional but does help the spring rolls to brown when frying.","To wrap each roll, place a rice paper wrapper into the sugar water for about 5-10 seconds, making sure it is completely submerged. Remove it from the water. It will still be quite firm, but it will soften quickly! ","Place about 40g of filling in a log shape on one side of the wrapper. Begin tightly folding the wrapper over the filling (no air bubbles!), and roll the spring roll forward 1 complete revolution. Lightly press down on each end of the filling to flatten the rice paper and push the filling together to eliminate any air bubbles. ","Fold one side of the wrapper towards the middle of the spring roll. Repeat with the other side. Roll the spring roll forward while tucking in the front to prevent air pockets. The rice paper wrapper will stick to itself. It doesn’t require anything additional to seal. Place the rolls on a plate or sheet pan lined with a clean, dry kitchen towel or parchment paper. ","Once wrapped, transfer the spring rolls to the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour, so they can dry out and firm up. This step helps minimize the wrapper bubbling when frying (though bubbling is normal). Take them out of the refrigerator 15 minutes before frying.","Heat about 3 cups of canola or vegetable oil in a medium pot to 335°F/170°C (the oil level should be a little over halfway up the sides). Fry the spring rolls in small batches—about three at a time. Make sure they do not touch just after they are placed in the oil as the skins will be sticky until a crust forms. Cook each batch for 5 to 6 minutes, or until light golden brown. (Frying them in small batches prevents them from sticking to each other.)","Use a metal slotted spoon to pull them out of the oil. Drain on a rack, and continue frying. Maintain the correct oil temperature by periodically adjusting your heat. ","When ready to serve, refry the spring rolls (yes, they need to be fried twice) at 350°F/175°C for 1 ½ to 2 minutes to make them nice and crispy. Double-frying is important! Serve with fresh lettuce, cilantro, Thai basil, mint and nuoc cham for dipping."],"ingredients":[{"name":"dried mung bean noodles","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(1 package)","amount":"50","measurement":"g"}},{"name":"ground pork","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(70-80% lean; 450g)","amount":"1","measurement":"pound"}},{"name":"medium carrots","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(grated, about 30g)","amount":"2","measurement":""}},{"name":"rehydrated wood ear mushrooms","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(finely chopped, 30g)","amount":"1/3","measurement":"cup"}},{"name":"shallots","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(finely chopped, 30g)","amount":"1/4","measurement":"cup"}},{"name":"garlic","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(minced)","amount":"1","measurement":"clove"}},{"name":"ginger","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(grated)","amount":"1","measurement":"teaspoon"}},{"name":"egg white","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"1","measurement":""}},{"name":"fish sauce","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"1","measurement":"tablespoon"}},{"name":"vegetable oil","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"1","measurement":"tablespoon"}},{"name":"salt","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"1/2","measurement":"teaspoon"}},{"name":"ground white pepper","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"1/4","measurement":"teaspoon"}},{"name":"sugar","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(12g - divided)","amount":"3","measurement":"teaspoons"}},{"name":"warm water","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(250 ml)","amount":"1","measurement":"cup"}},{"name":"dried rice paper wrappers","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(bánh tráng)","amount":"20","measurement":""}},{"name":"canola or vegetable oil ","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(for frying)","amount":"","measurement":""}},{"name":"Fresh green leaf lettuce, cilantro, Thai basil, and mint","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"","measurement":""}},{"name":"Nuoc cham dipping sauce","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(see our Nuoc cham recipe)","amount":"","measurement":""}}],"tags":[{"name":"Appetizer"},{"name":"Vietnamese"},{"name":"cha gio"}]},

This is the sauce that you'll be adding to the rice, and it's much easier to have it combined and ready to go before you start cooking.","Take your cooked rice and fluff it with a fork or with your hands (you can rinse your hands in cold water if the rice starts sticking to them). There shouldn't be any big clumps!","With the wok over medium heat, add a tablespoon of oil and sauté the onions until translucent and then stir in the roast pork. Add the rice and mix well. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed up, which will take about 5 minutes. If the rice was made fresh, then you just need to mix until everything is incorporated.","Add the sauce mixture and salt and mix with a scooping motion until the rice is evenly coated with sauce. You will have to break up any remaining clumps of rice with the spatula as best as possible, but no need to be obsessive. The rice should be hot by this time.","Toss in your mung bean sprouts, scrambled eggs, and scallions.
