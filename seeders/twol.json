Flip the meat over so it’s skin-side up.","So, to do the next step, there’s actually a special tool that restaurants use, but we just used a sharp metal skewer.

{"name":"BBQ Char Siu Roast Pork on the Grill","source":"The Woks of Life","servings":"6","activeTime":"35","totalTime":"35","directions":["Cut the pork into long 1 1/2 to 2-inch thick pieces. There is a technique to cutting pork that I learned from my father. First, find where the meat has the fat and the membrane between the muscle, and use a sharp knife to cut and separate them. My father always said that if you look at the pork closely, it will show you how it wants to be cut by following the muscle membrane lines. This is a brilliant way to do it, because you end up with the fat and the tougher membrane on the outside, protecting the tender meat and keeping it juicy on the grill. The marinade and heat also break down this membrane, so it won’t be tough at all.","Once you have your pieces of meat separated, you can decide if they need to be cut further into manageable pieces since grilling involves more handling and moving/turning of the meat than roasting in the oven. You will most likely have to butterfly the thicker pieces of the meat to get the desired thickness. Always start where the meat starts to be thicker; cut towards and into the thickest part, stop 1½ inches from the end and butterfly the meat. This method for breaking down the pork also applies to roasting Chinese BBQ pork in the oven. I included some pictures and details since we got quite a few questions after posting the oven-roasted version.","Mix all of the marinade ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Place the pork into a gallon zip top bag, and pour the marinade mix in. Seal the bag and work the marinade into the meat until every piece is evenly coated. Refrigerate overnight.","The next day, place the pork on a plate, making sure to shake off the excess marinade in the bag. Too much marinade left on the meat will increase the chances of burning your pork. Pour the rest of the marinade into a bowl and add the rest of the basting ingredients; get your basting brush ready.","Preheat your grill, making sure it's extremely hot. You want a nice sear on the meat to seal in the juices before you turn it, but try not to get it too crispy on one side. You will be turning the meat often during the cooking process to prevent burning and make sure that marinade gets nice and caramelized. On a hot grill, you should be cooking it for about 3 minutes before flipping it.","After both sides are seared, you can turn the grill down slightly to prevent drying out the meat. Turn the meat often; I did every 2 to 3 minutes making sure to get an even sear on all sides. I also started to brush and baste the meat after each turn to keep it moist and flavorful. If the meat looks like it starts to get dry on the surface, it needs to be basted.","Continue this turning and basting for another 20 to 30 minutes and make sure you don’t walk away from the grill! With all of this marinade, the roast pork could burn to a crisp very quickly, so protect your time and investment! Also make sure that you stop basting a few minutes before you pull the meat off the grill since the marinade was in contact with raw meat.","You can check the pork with a meat thermometer to be sure it’s done (145 degrees F), and remove it from the grill to let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing.

You can decide for yourself, but be aware that skin-on chicken is more prone to flare-ups when grilling. You’ll have to watch the chicken more closely while it’s on the grill and flip the pieces more often to avoid hot spots--all reasonable trade-offs for some extra flavor!","Place the chicken in a large dish. Spread the marinade all over the chicken and let marinate at least 12 hours, but not more than 2 days. We marinated our chicken for 16 hours, and even more marinating time wouldn’t have hurt!","Be sure to take the chicken out of the refrigerator 3 to 4 hours prior to grilling, so the chicken can come to room temperature--kind of like how you never want to grill a cold steak.

Cover with water and allow to soak for 20 minutes.","While that’s happening, heat your oil/butter/ghee in a saucepan. When it’s melted, add the cumin seeds, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Let the spices infuse the oil for 2-3 minutes. After the rice has finished soaking, drain it thoroughly and add it to the spice mixture.

Coarsely chop the fish (no need to make it into a paste-like texture at this stage). Add the fish to a large mixing bowl along with the rest of the filling ingredients. Whip in one direction using chopsticks or a wooden spoon for a good 5 minutes until the filling becomes gooey and sticky. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.","Now we are ready to assemble the dumplings! When the dough is done resting, cut it into eighths. Take one of your smaller pieces of dough, keeping the rest of the pieces covered to prevent them from drying out. Roll the small piece of dough into a thick cylinder on a clean and lightly floured surface. Cut the cylinder into 10-gram pieces using a kitchen scale. Now take one piece, and roll it from edge to center with a small rolling pin as you turn the dough in a circular motion.

Position the dumpling so that each side is held in place by your thumb and index finger (this is a two-handed operation). Then with gentle pressure, press the two sides of the wrappers closed tightly. At the same time, press the filling slightly downward, by bringing your wrists slightly closer.

When you reach the tough base of the leaf, discard. Throw your bok choy into a large bowl with lots of cold water. Agitate the veggies with your hands and/or use your faucet sprayer to loosen any dirt. Soak for 5 to 10 minutes.","Scoop the veggies into a colander and rinse the bowl clean of any sand. Repeat the process until you don’t see any dirt on the leaves or at the bottom of your bowl. We tend to wash leafy greens three times, and then we use the water to water plants! Once the washed bok choy is in a colander, give it a good shake to release any excess water.","Heat your wok or large pan over low heat and add the oil. Immediately add the ginger first (if using) and then the garlic (if you don't feel like mincing garlic, you can use a garlic press, one of our most often used kitchen tools! It gives the dish a much more garlicky flavor.).","Once you have the ginger and garlic in the pan, add the veggies and turn the heat up to the highest setting. Stir-fry using a scooping motion so the ginger, garlic and oil are evenly distributed among the vegetables. This first 30 seconds is a critical time not to let your aromatics burn and to cook your veggies evenly.","Next, add salt, sugar, sesame oil, white pepper, and the MSG and hot chicken stock if using. (Using hot chicken stock is important to maintaining the temperature of the wok). Stir fry uncovered for another 1-2 minutes. Plate and serve immediately. You may have a little or a lot of liquid, depending upon the heat of your stove and how much water was left in your vegetables after washing, so use a deep dish for serving.

If you can’t find these bamboo leaves, then you can use parchment paper as a substitute.","Soak your dried shiitake mushrooms in a bowl of hot water and place a small plate on top to ensure they are fully submerged for 30 minutes. Cut the stems off the mushrooms and discard them. Return the mushrooms to the water if they still seem dry inside, since thicker mushrooms will take longer to rehydrate. Finely chop the mushrooms and set aside, reserving the water you used to soak them.","Soak your dried shrimp in hot water for 30 minutes. Pour the shrimp out into a strainer and give them a quick rinse before chopping them.","Heat 5 tablespoons (75 ml) vegetable oil in a frying pan or wok on medium low heat. Scoop out about 2 tablespoons of the heated oil and set aside for brushing the cha guo after they come out of the steamer.","Add the dried shrimp to the oil and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Next, add the ground pork and stir-fry for another 30 seconds, or until it is opaque. Stir in the chopped shiitake mushrooms and the Shaoxing wine.","Next, add the grated daikon radish, chopped scallions, sesame oil, oyster sauce, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, sugar, and white pepper. Cook on medium low heat until simmering and continue to simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until the daikon radish is just tender.","Combine 2 teaspoons cornstarch with 1/4 cup of the reserved mushroom soaking liquid, being careful to avoid any dirt or sediment that may have settled on the bottom of the bowl. Add to the wok, and continue to cook and stir until all standing liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Set aside and let cool completely.","In a large mixing bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour, all purpose flour, tapioca starch, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Gradually stir 2 cups of boiling water into the dry mixture and continue mixing with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until a dough begins to form. Once the mixture is cool enough to touch, knead the dough into a smooth ball. Add extra glutinous rice flour 1 tablespoon at a time if the dough is too sticky to knead. Once smooth, cover the dough in the bowl with an overturned plate, and let it rest for 20 minutes.","NOTE: Don’t be thrown off by the amount of dough in the photographs.

Use a rolling pin to roll out the edges of the disc until it is about 3 ½ to 4 inches in diameter. It’s important to make the edges of the disc slightly thinner than the middle, or you will have too much dough on one side after you pinch and close the edges.","Next, put 35 g of filling in the middle of the dough disc. Use a spoon to press the filling together into ball so there are no air pockets in the filling. Here, you can again use your kitchen scale to measure how much filling you are using for each cha guo rice cake in order to achieve a uniform size.","Next, pinch the dough around the edges of the disc until the opening is closed. The side of the cha guo tea cake you just closed will be the bottom, so no need to worry if the seam is not smooth. Just make sure it is closed and does not leak.","Next, brush your reserved “cooked” vegetable oil on one of your cut zong leaves and also on the bottom of the cha guo, and place the cha guo onto the leaf. Gently press until it is flattened slightly.","Place the cha guo in a bamboo steamer or metal steamer, ensuring that there is at least an inch of space between each one. You should be able to fit 4 to 5 cha guo rice cakes on one level. Stack your bamboo steamer levels to steam more tea cakes in one batch. Steam your cha guo rice tea cakes in batches for 10 minutes each.","Once done, sprinkle a pinch of toasted sesame seeds on top of each rice cake and gently press them in place. Use a basting brush to lightly brush some of the cooked oil you reserved earlier over each cha guo to prevent them from drying out.","Remove the cha guo to a plate and serve them warm anytime!

{"name":"Chinese Seafood Bird Nest Banquet Dish","source":"The Woks of Life","servings":"6","activeTime":"15","totalTime":"45","directions":["For the taro basket, spread the julienned taro in a criss-cross pattern over a large steel mesh strainer, letting some of the taro hang over the edges. The taro will be slightly wet and starchy after it is julienned, which is exactly what you want for maximum adhesion. Take another steel mesh strainer of the same size and place it over the top so the taro strands are sandwiched between the two strainers.","In a wok or pot, heat 6 cups of oil to 325 degrees F (use a thermometer to check the temperature), and place the “nest,” still sandwiched between the two strainers, in the oil. Fry until golden brown, tilting the basket in different angles so the entire taro basket is fried evenly. Using a wok for frying is ideal, as you will have more room without having to use excessive amounts of oil, but a deep pot large enough for the basket will work also. Be sure to place the taro basket in the pot slowly and use the utmost caution! Using a deeper pot or wok also makes frying safer since the taro basket, when first placed into the oil, will cause the oil to expand and overflow if your pot is too small and if your oil is too close to the top of the pot.","For the seafood, make sure your shrimp and scallops are cleaned.","Prepare the squid by separating the tentacles and body and removing the hard skeleton parts. Use the tentacles as is, and set them aside to drain. Cut the mantle so you have flat pieces, and remove the inside skeleton. Cut the flat pieces into 2 by 3 inch rectangles, and score them diagonally in a criss-cross pattern, making sure not to cut the squid all the way through.","Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in your wok, and blanch the shrimp and scallops by slowly stirring them in the water until just opaque (about 20 seconds), and transfer to a plate. The shrimp and scallops should be just 70% cooked, since they will be cooked again in the stir-fry step of the dish.","Add the squid to the hot water, and blanch until they are curled, or about 10 seconds, and transfer these to a plate. Asian grocery stores sometimes stock prepared squid that is cut and blanched into curls in the freezer section; if you have access, it’s a handy shortcut!","Heat your wok over medium-high heat, and coat the perimeter of the wok with two tablespoons of oil. Heat until the oil slides easily around the wok and starts to shimmer.","Add the ginger slices to the wok, and let fry for about 10 seconds. Add the scallion and garlic, and stir-fry for another 10 seconds.","Next, add the carrots, bamboo shoots, and peppers, and turn the heat up to high. Give everything a good stir-fry for 30 seconds, and then add the straw mushrooms, snap peas, and onion.","Next, stir in the seafood, and add the Shaoxing wine. Stir-fry everything for another minute and add the hot chicken stock. It’s important to add hot or even boiling chicken stock to keep the wok up to temperature, especially since most average stoves can have trouble generating enough heat for a good stir fry in the first place. You can also add more or less chicken stock depending on how much sauce you want in the dish.","While the mixture is coming up to a boil, add the salt, sugar, white pepper, and sesame oil, and stir everything until well combined. Taste the sauce with a spoon, and add more seasonings to your preference, but be quick about it, or your seafood may overcook!","Mix together the cornstarch and water so that it’s uniformly combined, and add to the wok slowly while stirring. Again, you can add more, less, or leave it out entirely depending upon your taste preferences, but it’s best to get to a consistency so that the sauce coats all of the ingredients.","Carefully spoon the mixture into your taro basket, and serve immediately!"],"ingredients":[{"name":"taro","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(julienned)","amount":"4","measurement":"cups"}},{"name":"canola oil","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(for frying)","amount":"6","measurement":"cups"}},{"name":"large shrimp","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(16 to 20 size, about 6 ounces/170g by weight; peeled and deveined)","amount":"6","measurement":""}},{"name":"large diver or sea scallops","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(about 6 ounces/170g by weight)","amount":"6","measurement":""}},{"name":"whole squid","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(170g, cleaned)","amount":"6","measurement":"ounces"}},{"name":"canola oil","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(divided)","amount":"3","measurement":"tablespoons"}},{"name":"fresh ginger slices","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(⅛-inch thick)","amount":"8","measurement":""}},{"name":"scallions","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(white parts only, sliced at an angle into 1½-inch pieces)","amount":"2","measurement":""}},{"name":"garlic","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(thinly sliced)","amount":"2","measurement":"cloves"}},{"name":"of a carrot","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(cut into a star pattern about ⅛-inch thick)","amount":"½","measurement":""}},{"name":"bamboo shoots","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(rinsed and drained)","amount":"½","measurement":"cup"}},{"name":"of a whole red bell pepper","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(cut into 1-inch slices)","amount":"¼","measurement":""}},{"name":"straw mushrooms","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(fresh or canned)","amount":"½","measurement":"cup"}},{"name":"sugar snap peas","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(tips removed)","amount":"1","measurement":"cup"}},{"name":"small red onion","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(cut into 1-inch pieces)","amount":"1","measurement":""}},{"name":"Shaoxing wine","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"2","measurement":"teaspoons"}},{"name":"hot chicken stock","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"1","measurement":"cup"}},{"name":"salt","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"1","measurement":"teaspoon"}},{"name":"sugar","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"¼","measurement":"teaspoon"}},{"name":"ground white pepper","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"1/8","measurement":"teaspoon"}},{"name":"sesame oil","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"","amount":"½","measurement":"teaspoon"}},{"name":"cornstarch","Recipe_Ingredient":{"specifics":"(mixed with 1½ tablespoons warm water, optional)","amount":"1½","measurement":"tablespoons"}}],"tags":[{"name":"Fish and Seafood"},{"name":"Chinese"},{"name":"seafood bird's nest"}]},

Cover and bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a simmer until the beans are softened and opened-up (about 30 minutes). Stir periodically to avoid burning.","If you see a lot of liquid remaining even after the beans are softened and have opened up, turn up the heat, remove the lid, and let the liquid cook off. While you’re doing this, watch the beans closely and stir occasionally to avoid burning. Remove from the heat and let the beans cool for a bit before pureeing the cooked beans in a food processor. You can also use an immersion blender, but a food processor will result in a more even puree.","Put the red bean puree in a thick-bottomed pan set over medium-high heat, and cook off the liquid, stirring constantly. This process will take about 25 to 30 minutes. Add the sugar (about 1/2 cup or to taste) early in the cooking process so it has a chance to fully dissolve.","Towards the end of the cooking time, add the ¼ cup of vegetable oil in two batches. The oil will prevent the puree from sticking to the pan too much. The paste is done once it “stays” in place rather than oozing across the pan. Transfer the paste to a dish, and let it cool before storing it in the refrigerator, covered.","Rinse the sweet rice a couple of times until the water runs clear rather than cloudy. Next, transfer the rice to a large bowl with enough water so that the water line is ½-inch above the rice. Stir in 1½ tablespoons of lye water and ½ tablespoon vegetable oil. Once the lye water hits the fresh water, both the rice and water will turn a light yellow color––that’s normal.

{"name":"Chinese Fried Pigeon (Squab), A Hong Kong Favorite","source":"The Woks of Life","servings":"4","activeTime":"40","totalTime":"40","directions":["Make sure the pigeon/squab are cleaned well, removing any internal organs. Squab in the US almost always come frozen, and oftentimes, they only come dressed on the outside, which means that you must cut a small opening near the tail in order to remove the remove the organs and clean the inside.","Take care to cut a small opening, and not to rip the skin when cleaning it. The best cut to make is a small horizontal cut 1 to 1½ inches wide between the tail and the bottom of the breast. It’s the same place where all poultry are cut and cleaned out. Once the cut is made, you’ll have to carefully use two fingers to pull out the entrails--including the heart, gizzard, liver, lungs and any glands that are attached to the cavity. It will take a few passes and lots of rinsing with cold water to get them cleaned out.","After the insides are thoroughly cleaned, use kitchen shears to clip off the talons and tuck the feet inside the cavity. You can also just cut off the claws (some old folks like to eat them with a cold beer) and just leave the legs. For a Chinese New Year bird, Chinese people tend to leave the legs, tail, and head intact. It is an old Chinese tradition to serve any bird with both the head and tail on for Chinese New Year dinner. It’s true also for the classic poached chicken, Cantonese white cut chicken, which is a required dish at all Cantonese Lunar New Year dinners!","In a medium-sized pot, add the ginger, garlic, scallions, sugar, salt, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, Chinese spice packet, water, and bring to a boil. The liquid should be quite salty––almost as salty as the sea, like when you cook pasta. Turn the heat down and let the sauce simmer for 15 minutes.","Next, carefully place the squab into the pot until they are fully submerged, and the cavities are filled with the hot liquid. Lift the squab out, emptying the liquid inside the cavity and return them back to the pot, again ensuring there are no air pockets in the cavity. This is the same method used in our classic Cantonese poached chicken; it ensures that there are no cold spots and that the poultry cooks evenly.","Reduce the heat to the lowest setting so the liquid is almost (but not actually) simmering. Let the squab cook for 30 minutes. Another easier method is to let the liquid simmer for 5 minutes with the squab, then turn off the heat completely, and leave the pot covered on the stove for another 25 minutes.","While the squab is cooking, prepare a large bowl of cold water. After the squab are done, remove them from the braising liquid, and soak them in the cold water, gently rubbing off any impurities from the skin that may have appeared from the cooking process. Let them cool completely in the water.","While the squab are cooling in the water, mix together the maltose, red vinegar, water, and Shaoxing wine until the maltose is dissolved. Maltose is not an easy ingredient to handle. It’s quite stiff and has the texture of taffy. Use your hand to remove the maltose from the measuring spoon and rub it into the water and vinegar mixture to help it dissolve.","Remove the squab from the water, gently shaking off any excess liquid. Roll the pigeon in the maltose vinegar mixture, using your hands to ensure all of the surface area gets coated. Do your best to keep the vinegar and maltose solution on the outside of the pigeon only. This maltose vinegar bath gives the skin a light coating that ensures crispy skin during the frying process.","Once the pigeons are thoroughly marinated, set aside, and air dry for a total of 2 hours. If you have a fan, point one at the birds to speed up the drying process. Turn the pigeons over after 1 hour and use a towel to wipe any liquid from the plate so it is dry. This bath and drying process is another measure to ensure that your traditional fried pigeon dish will have a crispy skin.","Now it’s time to fry the squab. Heat 6 cups of canola oil to 350 degrees F in a small wok. Use a thermometer to ensure the temperature is accurate. Usually, I recommend a small pot for deep frying to save oil, but in this case, it’s best to use a small round bottomed wok for frying.","Once your oil has come up to temperature, place one of the squab on the Chinese spider strainer breast down, and carefully lower it into the hot oil. At the same time, use your metal hoak or ladle to repeatedly spoon hot oil over the top of the pigeon. Make sure you pour hot oil over the head, neck, legs and tail. Try to angle the pigeon so the cavity opening is pointed down. Don’t pour oil into the cavity.","Repeat this process, turning the squab over if needed until your fried pigeon is a uniform amber color. How dark you want your fried pigeon is a personal preference. My experience eating this dish at restaurants is that they are generally a darker amber color. Repeat the process, one-by-one, for the rest of the squab.","The way to serve these fried pigeons is to cut off the head and place them at the head of the plate. We do the same thing for Cantonese Ginger Scallion Lobster. Cut off the claws and set them at the bottom of the plate opposite the heads. Next, use a chef’s knife or kitchen shears to cut the fried pigeon in half lengthwise and cut each half into a breast and leg quarter piece for a total of four pieces.

Add the water and stir for at least three minutes until the dry ingredients are well-dissolved. Set aside and allow time for any air bubbles to dissipate.","Prepare a large assembly station by brushing some oil on a clean, smooth surface like a non-porous countertop, a large flat plate, or a smooth cutting board. I've found a large smooth plate works best, as it has the least amount of friction. ","Next, pre-boil the water in your steamer or wok with the lid on (more on how to set up a steamer here), making sure your wok or steamer fits the flat-bottomed pan you will use to cook the rice noodles. I used a 9 x 13 inch non-stick sheet pan. This recipe makes 2 full sheets of rice noodles in this sized pan (equivalent to about two dim sum orders).","Now lift the soaking wet cotton cloth out of the water and line the bottom of the pan with it. Do not wring out the water! ","Re-stir the starch and water mixture well before adding just enough to cover the cloth at the bottom of the pan completely. Too much means too thick of a rice noodle. The water in your steamer should be boiling. Use the plate gripper and carefully lower the pan into the steamer or directly onto the simmering water if you’re using a wok. Make sure the pan is perfectly level, or the noodles will be too thick on one side and too thin on the other. Immediately cover the lid and steam on high for 2 minutes. All of this must happen quickly.","When 2 minutes have elapsed, remove the pan from the steamer using the plate gripper, and transfer to your assembly station. Carefully lift the cloth out of the pan and place it with the rice noodle side down onto the oiled surface you prepared earlier. Use the dough scraper and your hands to carefully scrape the rice noodle sheet off of the cotton cloth and lift the cloth away so the noodle is in a single layer on the oiled surface. This step must happen quickly while the noodle and cotton cloth are still hot. The noodle might have a small hole here or there––don’t fret. It does not affect the tastiness or look of the end result!","Line up one crispy youtiao along the long side of the rice noodle. Using the dough scraper, roll it up in the rice sheet so it’s in one long cigar. Cut each into bite-sized pieces, drizzle with the prepared sauce, and eat while it’s still hot!

Add the ginger. After about 10 seconds, turn the ginger over for another 10 seconds and push them to the side. The wok should be hot but not smoking too much (an indication that the wok is too hot). The ginger should be slightly caramelized but not burned.","Use a paper towel to pat the fish dry again, and carefully place into the wok in one motion. Do not move the fish! After about 1 minute, turn the heat down to medium; you want to get a nice light crust on the skin without it burning. Tilt the wok carefully one side at a time so the oil distributes around the perimeter of the fish, including the head and the tail. You can add more oil around the perimeter of the wok if you want some extra insurance against sticking.","Continue frying the fish for 5 to 6 minutes on the first side. At this point, a light crust should have formed, and you can give the wok a little shake now--the fish should slide around easily. If not, you can use a metal spatula to lift the fish slightly and peek underneath to check the color and to make sure the fish is not sticking. The fish should be a nice golden brown.","If the fish still sticks, then you probably have the heat too low, so turn it up slightly, add a little more oil, and let it cook for another 1 to 2 minutes! Once you have the fish sliding around in the wok or pan and the first side is golden brown, then you are ready for the flip! Carefully slide the spatula under the middle of the fish on the side towards the middle of the wok and in one steady motion, lift and flip it towards the outside of the wok. Repeat the same “flip” for the other fish.","Let the fish fry on the second side for another 4 minutes and again, add some oil if you think it is necessary. While the fish is frying, dissolve the sugar and hot water in a small bowl, and add the soy sauce, white pepper, and sesame oil (if using). Set aside.","Shake the wok to make sure the fish is not stuck. Next, add the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok and let cook off for 30 seconds. Pour the soy sauce mixture around the perimeter of the wok and turn the heat back up until the sauce is simmering (about 30 seconds).

Then, mix in the sesame oil.","After the oysters have drained, lightly pat each of them dry with a paper towel, and dredge each oyster lightly with flour. I know it’s tempting to dredge all of the oysters at once in a glob, but it’s best to dredge each oyster individually just before you batter and fry them to ensure they are fully and evenly coated.","After dredging, dip each oyster into the batter so it is fully coated. Lift them out of the batter carefully--you can use the edge of the bowl to scrape off excess batter if needed.","Now you’re ready to deep fry the oysters. Check the temperature of the oil again with your thermometer. As you are frying, you should adjust the heat to maintain a temperature between 325 degrees F and 350 degrees F, because the oil will cool quickly as you drop in the battered oysters and then quickly heat again as they cook.","Lower the oyster halfway into the oil and slowly swirl it for 2 or 3 seconds so the batter cooks slightly, and then drop it into the oil. This process prevents the oyster from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Fry the oysters in batches, depending upon the size of your pot and the amount of oil you are using. For this recipe, we fried oysters in batches of 3 or 4 depending upon their size.","Use a slotted spoon to lift the oysters out when they are golden brown and transfer them to a metal cooling rack to drain.

{"name":"Cantonese Poached Chicken (Bai Qie Ji)","source":"The Woks of Life","servings":"6","activeTime":"50","totalTime":"10","directions":["Make sure your chicken is at room temperature (trying to poach a cold chicken right out of the refrigerator will result in uneven cooking or undercooking). Clean the chicken by rinsing it under cold water, paying special attention to the cavity. Any giblets should already be removed but there may still be organs on the inside that should be removed or sometimes stray feathers that need to be plucked. Experts recommend that it's not necessary to wash your chicken before cutting and cooking but in this case for a whole chicken (especially if you get it from a live poultry place or even from Asian markets), it's a step that shouldn't be skipped, in my opinion.  When washing and prepping the whole chicken, be very careful about splashing water and contaminating surfaces with unwanted bacteria. Be careful not to break or trim away any of the skin on the chicken, as you don’t want the meat exposed to the boiling water as it cooks. This will ensure a moist, silky texture in the final product. ","Fill a large stock pot with water, just enough to submerge the chicken completely. You can determine this by putting the entire chicken in the pot, filling it with water until the chicken is submerged, and then removing the chicken. Do not turn on the heat while the chicken is still in the pot! This method of ensuring you have just enough water to submerge the chicken (and avoiding any extra) will ensure you have a more flavorful stock to save at the end. We used about 18 cups of water to submerge a 4 pound chicken in a deep stock pot.","Once you have your water properly measured into the pot, add 2 scallions and 5 slices of ginger, and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, slowly lower the chicken into the pot, legs down and head up. It’s ok if the breast is peeking out of the water a bit. The water will cool down and stop boiling when you add the chicken, so bring it up to a boil once again, and do not walk away from the pot.","Once the water boils again, IMMEDIATELY lift the chicken out of the water very carefully. You can carefully hook two wooden spoons under the wings to lift the chicken up. The goal is to empty any colder water that may be trapped inside the cavity. Once you’ve released that water, lower the chicken back into the pot, and bring to a boil again. ","When the water is JUST starting to boil, turn the heat down. Keep it at barely a simmer. There should be very little movement in the water, but it also shouldn’t be still. Cover the pot, and keep the heat around the lowest setting so the liquid continues to simmer slowly. Cook for about 35-40 minutes, roughly 10-11 minutes per pound. Depending on the size of your chicken, it may take more or less time to cook it through. You can check to make sure the water is bubbling slowly/gently and not boiling too vigorously, but try to avoid uncovering the pot while it’s cooking.","Poke a chopstick or skewer into the thigh to check for doneness. If the juices run clear, it's done. Carefully lift the chicken out of the pot and transfer it to a large bowl of ice water. Cool completely. ","While the chicken is cooling, make the sauce. You have the option to make two versions—one with just scallions, ginger, oil and salt, and one with soy sauce. The plain version is more traditional, as it really lets the flavors of chicken, ginger, and scallion shine through. Judy loves to add soy sauce, and it’s also a tasty option! Start with the plain version, and then scoop some of it out into another bowl and add soy sauce. Try both and see which your loved ones like best!","When the chicken is out of the ice water, you can brush it lightly with oil or some of the fat floating atop the poaching liquid to give it that enticing, shiny look!","To serve, carve your chicken into pieces that you can easily grab with chopsticks.

{"name":"Crispy Fried Flounder, Chinese-Style","source":"The Woks of Life","servings":"8","activeTime":"20","totalTime":"35","directions":["The first step is to pat the fish dry with a paper towel on both sides. Next, rub the Shaoxing wine all over the fish on both sides. Mix together the salt and white pepper and rub it all over both sides of the flounder.","Next, lightly dredge both sides of the fish with cornstarch. I sifted the cornstarch over both sides of the fish to get a uniform, light coating. If you don’t have a sifter or fine-meshed strainer to do this, you may need to use a lot more than 3 tablespoons of cornstarch to dredge the fish. You can also try patting it all over the fish with your hands and then shaking off the excess.","Heat a  carbon steel wok or very large frying pan over high heat until it just starts to smoke. Next, pour ⅔ cup canola oil around the perimeter of the wok to ensure it is fully coated and turn the heat down to medium high.  Carefully place your fish in the wok.","A fish of this size will need 5 to 6 minutes on each side. You should be getting a good sizzle in the wok, and the oil should be bubbling as you cook the fish. Tilt the wok or pan so the oil reaches all parts of the fish, and soon the flounder will begin to slide around the wok with ease. At this point, you will have to use your wok spatula to hold the fish gently while you continue to tilt the wok to cook the fish evenly. Make sure that the side fins, tail, and fish head are fried evenly as well. This process takes some coordination, but it sounds harder than it is!","Note that this fried flounder recipe calls for ⅔ cup of oil, but if you double the amount, you can get better, crispier results and have a much easier time frying the flounder. However, keep in mind that all but a few tablespoons of oil will be discarded in the end.","You can check the fish by gently lifting up one side the flounder with a wok spatula (so it’s perpendicular to the fish) to see that it fried up to an even golden brown. If it’s ready, just continue the flipping motion steadily to turn it over. Flounder is large and unwieldy, so you can use two spatulas to do this. Another tip is to tilt the wok up on the side you are flipping to make things easier. If you are right handed, tilt the left side of the wok up and use your right hand to flip the fish to your left. Continue frying for another 5 minutes, tilting the wok as needed to make sure the edges fry up to a crispy finish.","Once the flounder is done on both sides, carefully scoop/slide it from the wok to a large plate. Before you do this, there’s a presentation decision--do you serve the flounder dark side (the “top” of the fish) or light side up (the “bottom” that skims the ocean floor)? Many restaurants like to serve it lighter side up, but I like to serve it dark side up. It’s the natural position of the fish, and it sits on the plate a bit better.","One you’ve plated the fish, scoop out the oil into a heatproof bowl, and wipe your wok clean with a paper towel.","Next, in a small bowl, mix the 2 teaspoons of hot water with the sugar, soy sauce and Shaoxing wine.","Use a spoon to skim out 3 tablespoons of oil from the bowl you set aside, taking care not to pick up any particles, and pour back into the wok, set over medium high heat. When the wok is just smoking, pour the sauce mixture in, stirring it until it comes to a boil, then turn off the heat.","Use the spatula to spread half of the sauce evenly over the fish, topping it off with the finely julienned scallions and chopped cilantro.

In the meantime, prepare the rest of the ingredients. Cut all of the vegetables to approximately the same size. You want everything the same size so each ingredient blends together.","Brown the pork over high heat in 2 tablespoons of oil, and add the garlic, mushrooms and carrots. Stir fry for 30 seconds, and add the bamboo shoots, napa cabbage, and Shaoxing wine. Continue stir-frying for a minute. Adjust the heat to simmer the mixture, as the napa cabbage will release a lot of moisture.","Stir in the soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, white pepper, and sugar. At this time, you have the option of adding 1/4 cup of the decanted water from soaking the dried mushrooms. It strengthens the mushroom flavor, so this is purely according to your personal preference. You may also have to simmer the filling longer to reduce the additional liquid.","Continue simmering the filling for another 3 minutes--until the napa cabbage is completely wilted--and stir in the corn starch slurry to thicken. How much slurry you add depends upon the wetness of the filling (this varies if your cabbage had more moisture or if you did add the optional mushroom water), but there should be no standing liquid at all.","Transfer the filling to a large shallow bowl, and let cool. Place into the refrigerator to cool further—at least one hour. It’s best to start with a cold filling for easier wrapping. The key to wrapping spring rolls is making sure that they’re tight, yet not overstuffed. It's best to use fresh spring roll wrappers if you can, as freezing the wrappers can result in the spring roll skin being a bit too damp.","Place the wrapper on a flat surface so that a corner is facing toward you. Use about two spoonfuls of the mixture per spring roll, and spoon it about 2 inches from the corner that is closest to you. Roll it over once, and, like you’re making a burrito, fold over both sides. Continue rolling it into a cigar shape. With your fingers, brush a bit of the cornstarch water onto the corner of the wrapper that is farthest from you to seal it.","In case you’re wondering, we did try egg wash instead of the cornstarch mixture to seal the spring roll but the egg wash \"stains\" the spring roll, so it's best to use the cornstarch mixture.","Place each roll on a tray. This recipe makes about 18-20 spring rolls. You can also freeze these spring rolls on the tray overnight, and transfer them to a zip-lock bag when they are completely frozen for future use. We usually fry some fresh and freeze the rest, unless we are hosting a party, in which case, these go like hot cakes!","To fry the spring rolls, fill a small pot (which requires less oil) with oil until it’s 2 to 3 inches deep. Heat the oil slowly over medium heat until it reaches 325 degrees. Gently add the spring rolls one at a time, frying in small batches. Carefully roll them in the oil so they cook evenly until golden brown and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels.","Prepare the dipping sauce by adding all ingredients to a small sauce pan.

Heat some water in a medium to large, deep pot. The water should be about 2 inches deep, and the pan should be large enough to accommodate the mixing bowl. Once the water boils, turn the heat to down to a simmer.","In a large heatproof bowl or the metal mixing bowl that came with your stand mixer, add the eggs and powdered sugar. Beat for a minute on low. Next, add the milk and heavy cream, and beat for a few seconds to combine. Then sift in the flour, starch, and dried milk powder. Mix everything in until there are no lumps. Now add in the melted butter, and stir to combine.","Next, carefully lower the mixing bowl into the pan of water, and begin stirring the mixture quickly and continuously. I used a stainless steel mixing bowl, so the egg mixture solidified rather quickly--it took about a minute. It’s essential that you stir quickly in this process. It may take longer if you use a thicker bowl. Once the egg mixture solidifies into a thick custard, remove from the heat. Do not overcook! Let it cool completely, and it’s ready to use.","Cover the custard to prevent it from drying out while you make the dough. Note: If you’d like to make the filling a day or two early, store it in an air-tight container and refrigerate it.","Now make the dough. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in ¼ cup of warm water. Let sit for 10-15 minutes until you see yeast bubbles floating on top of the water.","Now add in the flour, powdered sugar, salt, and coconut milk. Turn on the mixture with the dough hook attachment and set it to low, then slowly add in the regular milk, one tablespoon at a time until a dough is formed. A perfect dough should not stick to your hands or to the bowl--the texture should be smooth like a baby’s bottom!","Cover the dough with a dry kitchen towel, and let it proof for 1 hour in a warm (not hot) setting, I usually use the proofing setting in my oven. While the dough is proofing, let’s prepare a few things:","Equally divide the egg custard filling into 12 pieces and roll them in your palms to form round balls. Cover them to prevent them from drying out. Prepare the steamer. With this recipe, we will start steaming with cold water, so there is no need to pre-boil the water. Cut out twelve 4\"x4\" pieces of parchment paper.","The proofed dough should be about 2½-3 times its original size. Once the dough has finished proofing, put it back in the mixer and let it go for another 2-3 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles.","Now, transfer the dough to a clean and lightly floured surface. With the help of your kitchen scale, equally divide the dough into 12 pieces, and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you assemble the buns. Take one dough ball, roll it out into a 4-inch disc, taking care to make sure the edges are slightly thinner than the center. Put a ball of custard filling on top, pleat, and close the top of the bun--see the video! Place it on a piece of pre-cut parchment paper, and set it on your steaming rack. Repeat until all of the buns are assembled.","Put the buns in the steamer, covered with the lid (do not turn on the heat at this time). Let them sit and proof for another 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat on and set it to medium. Set your timer for 12 minutes. During these 12 minutes, the medium heat will slowly bring the water to a boil and steam the buns. It may seem slow and lack action at the beginning, but trust me, the buns will be steamed nicely after just 12 minutes.","VERY IMPORTANT NOTE!!! After the 12-minute timer (for steaming) goes off, set the timer for another 5 minutes and turn off the heat. DO NOT UNCOVER THE LID. The buns need about 5 minutes to cool and set or they will collapse, so be patient. They can only be revealed after the 5-minute timer goes off.","Eat them while they are hot, just like you would if they were straight off the dim sum cart.

If the dough falls apart as you roll it in between your palms, it’s too dry, but if the dough gets wetter as you roll it in between your palms, it’s too wet. Next, take a small piece—about 3 grams if you have a scale—and roll it into a small ball. Place it on a piece of parchment or clear plastic wrap. Repeat until you’ve used all the dough.
